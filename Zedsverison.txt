Additions in this version:

Always feed elders menu button:  
    Will only use necrocorns for elder feeding when this is enabled. 
    This is to ensure faster growth of Leviathan energy without auto purchase of unicorn graveyard making corruption much slowwer when fractional necrocorns remain.


No Buy Cryptotheology menu button:
    Stops all cryptotheology auto purchases so that you can play it your way. handy for building up bcoin hoard.

Hacked to stop auto purchase of Holy Genocide as it does nothing yet and is a waste of resources. 
Nasty hack as it relies of Holy Genocide being the last item in the list.
